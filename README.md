I rendered a hypercube and a mandelbrot set using my own python code

## Other files
- `stars_colored.svg` and `stars_grayscale.svg` are rendered diagrams of star-shaped polygons (I made them myself even though it looks just like on wikipedia)
- `angles.pdf` is somethign else I wrote. Just read it.
